## Usage

## What I've done
- Pagination
    - I've added the pagination when there are more than 2 entries
    - the current page stored in the url

- Select gender
    - I've added a component select to do the job

- Unit tests
    - I've added tests to all the componenets and libs! Yay!!
    - Please run `yarn run test`

- Helpers
    - I've alos created some helpers to help me configure the store and mock it in UT!

## Tasks

- Please add pagination support to the list when there are more than 2 entries
- Please add option to select sex of a friend male/female and display it
- Please add tests using your preferred testing tool (jest, mocha, should.js ...)

## Objectives

- You have received a working example so please do not upgrade any packages unless you really have to.
- Please check for small things like syntax errors, since details matter.
- Please deliver something that works, non working project is an automatic disqualification
